# Overview #
<p>
We proposed to give a solution for the problem of how to monitor the electricity consumption, for the purpose of regulating it and a solution to control these electric devices using remote access.<br>
</p><p>
As our system is based on a web application, we intended to design that with following features.<br>
</p><p>
The application will allow the customer to register for an account which requires a username and password. If a user wants to purchase the power controller kit, he can make his deal via this web application. After purchasing and setting this in their home or industry, through this application user can control the device.<br>
</p><p>
Our application can monitor the electricity consumption of ten equipments in his home. He can switch on or switch off these equipments from anywhere in the world through our web application. As well as he will receive an SMS to his mobile indicating the amount and the status of the equipments. For this task we planned to get support from a SMS gateway.<br>
</p><p>
The user can give an energy consumption limit for equipment and when equipment exceeds that limit, it will also be indicated in our application. So, if the user wants to switch off, he can do it through our application from anywhere.<br>
